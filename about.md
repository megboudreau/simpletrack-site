SimpleTrack allows you to define and customize items you wish to track and allows you to add entries with no more than a few clicks.

Want to track calories without having to tediously input every bite of food you eat?
Want to figure out how many days a week you're drinking alcohol?
Want to track grams of protein you eat in a day, or what days you managed to make it to the gym?
Trying to find a pattern to figure out what triggers your headaches?

SimpleTrack allows you to do all of this! You simply have to create items, name them, and give them a unit of measurement and starting tracking.

 A watch component makes it even more convenient to track the values you want from your wrist.
